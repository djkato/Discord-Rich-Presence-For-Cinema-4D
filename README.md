# Discord-Rich-Presence-For-Cinema-4D
A hacky way of allowing all your discord friends to know what your'e working on in Cinema 4D!

How it works:
>gets process info on c4D and takes windows name, extracts name from it
>hooks into discord api via npms `discord-rich-presence` and uses my custom app assets to show as cinema 4D, puts project name there

enjoy~
